This is my lab about methods to find the shortest path on Directed and Undirected Graphes. 
We use the abstract class "Graph.h", which defines the basic methods for working with graphs and creates inherited classes:
"DirectedGraph.h" and "UnDirectedGraph.h" (OOP method),
using breadth-first search we perform the task of finding the shortest path between vertices
